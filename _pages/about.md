Welcome and thank you for visiting my website! I am currently a graduate student at the School of Journalism and Communication, Nanjing University, China. My current research interests include computational communication, human-machine communication, and data journalism. I am particularly interested in the relationship between relatively disadvantaged groups (e.g., the elderly and teenagers) and machines in terms of communicative interactions and collaborative work. I am currently taking courses in Introduction to Computational Communication, Web Data Analytics, Principles and Innovations in News Narrative, and Future Editorial.

I received my undergraduate degree from Zhengzhou University's School of Journalism and Communication, specializing in Web and New Media. During my undergraduate studies, I took courses in data journalism, digital media narrative creation, online public opinion analysis and research, online cultural communication, and new media user research, gaining knowledge related to new media research and practice.
