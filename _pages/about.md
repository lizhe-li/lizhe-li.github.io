Welcome and thank you for visiting my website! I'm a researcher who focuses on human-computer relations. I am particularly interested in the relationship between relatively disadvantaged groups, such as the elderly and youth, and machines in terms of communication and interaction, and collaborative work.

I am currently a graduate student at the School of Journalism and Communication at Nanjing University in China.I received my Bachelor's degree from Zhengzhou University, School of Journalism and Communication, majoring in Web and New Media.
