This edited volume introduces readers to the growing area of Human-Machine Communication research within the communication discipline. As defined within this chapter,  HMC is the creation of meaning between humans and machines, with technology theorized as a communicator, a subject with which people communicate, instead of a channel through which humans interact with one another. HMC research focuses on the process of communication between human and machine and the implications of encounters between people and technology for individuals, society, and humanity. HMC envelopes communication research within HumanComputer Interaction, Human-Robot Interaction, and Human-Agent Interaction while at the same time is inclusive of philosophical, critical/cultural, and related approaches regarding the integration of social technologies into everyday spaces. This introduction outlines the fundamental aspects of HMC by answering key questions regarding HMCâ€™s historical and theoretical origins, the rationale for its establishment, and the nature of its research. This chapter highlights how deeply entrenched communication research has been within an anthropomorphic paradigm and how much work is yet to be done toward understanding what it means for people to communicate with robots, artificial intelligence, conversational agents, algorithms, and other emerging technologies.
