description: Guzman's article on human-computer communication

Artificial intelligence and people’s interactions with it—through virtual agents,socialbots, and language-generation software—do not fit neatly into paradigms of communication theory that have long focused on human–human communication. To address this disconnect between communication theory and emerging technology, this article provides a starting point for articulating the differences between communicative AI and previous technologies and introduces a theoretical basis for navigating these conditions in the form of scholarship within human–machine communication. Drawing on an HMC framework, we outline a research agenda built around three key aspects of communicative AI technologies: 1 the functional dimensions through which people make sense of these devices and applications as communicators, 2 the relational dynamics through which people associate with these technologies and, in turn, relate to themselves and others, and 3 the metaphysical implications called up by blurring ontological boundaries surrounding what constitutes human, machine, and communication.
