To address this disconnect between communication theory and emerging technology, this article provides a starting point for articulating the differences between communicative AI and previous technologies and introduces a theoretical basis for navigating these conditions in the form of scholarship within human–machine communication. Drawing on an HMC framework, we outline a research agenda built around three key aspects of communicative AI technologies: 1 the functional dimensions through which people make sense of these devices and applications as communicators, 2 the relational dynamics through which people associate with these technologies and, in turn, relate to themselves and others, and 3 the metaphysical implications called up by blurring ontological boundaries surrounding what constitutes human, machine, and communication.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[layout: post title: Artificial intelligence and communication: A Human–Machine Communication research agenda date: 2023-10-19 17:39:00 tags: links description: Guzman’s article on human-computer communication]]></summary></entry></feed>
